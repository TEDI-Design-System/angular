        spacing (margin-bottom) between child elements of a container. It is particularly useful for 
        maintaining consistent spacing in layouts without manually applying styles to each child element.</p>

        <p>Set the value of  <b>tediVerticalSpacing</b> to define the spacing size in  <b>em</b> units.</p>
        <p>The directive applies the margin-bottom to all direct child elements except the last one.</p>
        <p>Note: The directive does not affect nested (grandchild) elements.</p>
